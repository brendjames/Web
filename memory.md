# Project Memory

This file serves as a memory aid for the development process of the "Web" project. It is used to document:

- The current state of the project.
- Important notes and decisions made.
- Relevant details that need to be recalled between development interactions.

**Note:** Task completion is tracked in the project's To-Do list and should not be duplicated here.

## Current Status

Project initialized. The initial task is to create this `memory.md` file and then develop a website based on `prompt.md`.

**Update: Website Development - Phase 1 Complete**

The initial version of the website has been developed based on the `prompt.md` outline.

**Key accomplishments:**

1.  **Core HTML Structure:** Created `index.html` as the homepage and additional HTML files for key sections:
    *   `destinations.html`
    *   `how-it-works.html`
    *   `experiences.html`
    *   `about.html`
    *   `contact.html`
    *   `privacy.html`
    *   `terms.html`
2.  **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Tailwind CSS has been linked and used for styling across all pages, ensuring a responsive and modern design.
3.  **Homepage (`index.html`):** Implemented with:
    *   Hero section (placeholder visual).
    *   "How It Works" summary.
    *   Featured destinations teasers.
    *   Testimonials section (placeholders).
    *   Multiple CTAs.
4.  **Key Content Pages Populated:**
    *   `destinations.html`: Detailed content for South Africa and Bali, including overviews, surf spots, accommodation, activities, and placeholder media galleries. A "Costa Rica (Coming Soon!)" section was also added.
    *   `how-it-works.html`: Detailed 5-step process for custom trip planning.
    *   `contact.html`: Comprehensive inquiry form with various fields and other contact details. Includes a script to pre-fill destination from URL parameters.
5.  **Placeholder Content & Structure:**
    *   `experiences.html`: Structured with placeholder cards for various experiences.
    *   `about.html`: Structured with sections for mission, team, and why choose us.
    *   `privacy.html` & `terms.html`: Basic structure with placeholder legal text.
6.  **Navigation & Footer:** Consistent header navigation and footer implemented across all pages.
7.  **Styling and UX:** Applied consistent styling using Tailwind CSS, focusing on readability, responsiveness, and visual appeal (clean, modern, spacious layout with brand-aligned colors). Utilized the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin for content-heavy pages.

**Next Steps (Potential):**

*   Replace placeholder images and videos with actual professional media.
*   Flesh out content for `experiences.html` and `about.html`.
*   Implement backend functionality for the contact form.
*   Further SEO optimization.
*   Detailed testing across more devices and browsers.

**Update: "Ocean Feel" Design Refinements**

Based on user feedback, the website design has been updated to incorporate an "ocean feel."

**Key Refinements Implemented:**

1.  **Color Palette Overhaul:**
    *   **Primary Theme:** Shifted from a yellow-accented blue theme to a teal-accented ocean blue theme.
    *   **Body Background:** Changed to `bg-sky-50` (light sky blue).
    *   **Section Backgrounds:** Light sandy (`bg-stone-100`) or light blue (`bg-sky-100`) tones introduced.
    *   **CTAs & Accents:** Primary CTAs and key highlights now use vibrant teals (e.g., `bg-teal-500`). Secondary accents and links use sky blues.
    *   **Header & Footer:** Updated to deeper ocean blues (`bg-blue-700` for header, `bg-blue-800` for footer) with complementary link hover colors.

2.  **Homepage Enhancements:**
    *   Hero section overlay and accent colors adjusted for the new theme.
    *   "How It Works" icon colors and "Featured Destinations" link colors updated.
    *   Testimonial avatar borders and name colors changed.

3.  **Content Page Styling:**
    *   Page and section titles updated to new blue/sky theme colors.
    *   Primary CTA buttons consistently styled with the new teal theme.
    *   Inline links within `prose` content changed to use `sky` blue shades.
    *   Specific accents on `experiences.html` and `about.html` (card links, team member details) updated.

4.  **User Experience Improvements:**
    *   **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented site-wide using CSS for a more fluid navigation experience on same-page links.
    *   **Card Hover Effects:** Added a subtle "lift" effect (`hover:-translate-y-1`) to various content cards for enhanced interactivity.

5.  **Configuration Approach:**
    *   All styling changes were achieved using Tailwind CSS utility classes available via the CDN. No `tailwind.config.js` or custom build process was introduced in this iteration.

The overall visual aesthetic now more closely aligns with an "ocean" theme, aiming for a clean, modern, and engaging user experience.
