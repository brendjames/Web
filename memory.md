# Project Memory

This file serves as a memory aid for the development process of the "Web" project. It is used to document:

- The current state of the project.
- Important notes and decisions made.
- Relevant details that need to be recalled between development interactions.

**Note:** Task completion is tracked in the project's To-Do list and should not be duplicated here.

## Current Status

Project initialized. The initial task is to create this `memory.md` file and then develop a website based on `prompt.md`.
---
**Update: Website Development - Phase 1 Complete**

The initial version of the website has been developed based on the `prompt.md` outline.

**Key accomplishments:**

1.  **Core HTML Structure:** Created `index.html` as the homepage and additional HTML files for key sections:
    *   `destinations.html`
    *   `how-it-works.html`
    *   `experiences.html`
    *   `about.html`
    *   `contact.html`
    *   `privacy.html`
    *   `terms.html`
2.  **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Tailwind CSS has been linked and used for styling across all pages, ensuring a responsive and modern design.
3.  **Homepage (`index.html`):** Implemented with:
    *   Hero section (placeholder visual).
    *   "How It Works" summary.
    *   Featured destinations teasers.
    *   Testimonials section (placeholders).
    *   Multiple CTAs.
4.  **Key Content Pages Populated:**
    *   `destinations.html`: Detailed content for South Africa and Bali, including overviews, surf spots, accommodation, activities, and placeholder media galleries. A "Costa Rica (Coming Soon!)" section was also added.
    *   `how-it-works.html`: Detailed 5-step process for custom trip planning.
    *   `contact.html`: Comprehensive inquiry form with various fields and other contact details. Includes a script to pre-fill destination from URL parameters.
5.  **Placeholder Content & Structure:**
    *   `experiences.html`: Structured with placeholder cards for various experiences.
    *   `about.html`: Structured with sections for mission, team, and why choose us.
    *   `privacy.html` & `terms.html`: Basic structure with placeholder legal text.
6.  **Navigation & Footer:** Consistent header navigation and footer implemented across all pages.
7.  **Styling and UX:** Applied consistent styling using Tailwind CSS, focusing on readability, responsiveness, and visual appeal (clean, modern, spacious layout with brand-aligned colors). Utilized the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin for content-heavy pages.

**Next Steps (Potential):**

*   Replace placeholder images and videos with actual professional media.
*   Flesh out content for `experiences.html` and `about.html`.
*   Implement backend functionality for the contact form.
*   Further SEO optimization.
*   Detailed testing across more devices and browsers.
